\arguments{
\item{Gamma_hat}{The estimated exposure and outcome effects gamma_hat}

\item{Sd_hat}{The standarded errors of gamma_hat}

\item{init}{Starting value for gibbs sampler. Either "Random" or "EM"}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations for gibbs sampler}

\item{warmup}{The length of warm-up periods}

\item{second}{Whether to run the second stage. Default is False.}

\item{inv}{When inv = False, we are estiming B in Gamma = (I + B) alpha;
inv = True, we are estimating B in Gamma = B Gamma + alpha.}

\item{cor}{The correlation matrix of noise.}

is F}

\item{total}{Whether to include the total effects. Default is F}

\item{summary_second} The summary table of second stage (included if second  = T)
\item{total_effect_first} The total effect of each exposure on the outcome,
computed by first stage (included if total = T)
\item{total_effect_second} The total effect of each exposure on the outcome,
computed by second stage (included if total = T and second = T)

computed by first stage (included if indirect = T)
\item{indirect_effect_second} The indirect effect of each exposure on the outcome,
computed by second stage (included if indirect = T and  second = T)
